                <h1> About Me </h1>
                <p>Hello! My name is Khadijat Kokumo (she/her). I am a third-year at Northwestern University studying Biomedical Engineering and Computer Science. I am originally from Marietta, Georgia and Lagos, Nigeria. My interests are in bridging biomedical engineering and computer science to improve current technology in the medical field. <br><br> STEM is something that I am really passionate and am excited to continue as a future career. As a first-generation college student, I xxx. This past summer, I was able to work on improving the technology for breast ultrasound (further detailed under 'Projects'), and in the future, I hope to continue doing work related to directly impacting current biomedical technologies. <br><br> Outside of academics, I enjoy watching and playing basketball as I am currently the Co-Head Manager of the Northwestern Women's Basketball Team. I also love to dance, taking role in two dance teams on campus. Reading novels, watching shows, and enjoying concerts are also some of my favorite activities to relax. </p>
